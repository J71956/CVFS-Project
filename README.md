Introduction:
This is a an in-memory Virtual File System (VFS), named the Comp VFS (CVFS), which is made in Java and utilizes OOP concepts to simulate a file system. The user opens application .java to start the program and use the file system. This is a group project made by Siu Yau Shing and Chow Kwan Ho.

The application uses the Model-View-Controller Pattern in Designing the CVFS. Simply run Application.Java and the program would start.

Effect: Creates a new document in the working directory with the specified name, type, and content.
Steps:
1.	Ensure you are in the desired directory.
2.	Type newDoc followed by the document name, type, and content (e.g., newDoc myfile txt "Hello World").
3.	Press Enter.
Creating a New Directory
Command: newDir dirName

Constructing Simple Criteria
Command: newSimpleCri criName attrName op val
Effect: Constructs a simple criterion that can be referenced by criName.

1.	Type newSimpleCri followed by the criterion name, attribute name, operator, and value (e.g., newSimpleCri cr1 name "contains‚Äù "report").
2.	Press Enter.
Checking if a File is a Document
Criterion name: IsDocument
Effect: Evaluates to true if and only if the file is a document.
Steps:
1.	Use this criterion in search commands to filter documents.
Constructing Composite Criteria
Command: newNegation criName1 criName2
Effect: Constructs a composite criterion that is the negation of an existing criterion.
Steps:
1.	Type newNegation followed by the new criterion name and the existing criterion name (e.g., newNegation cr2 cr1).
2.	Press Enter.
Command: newBinaryCri criName1 criName3 logicOp criName4
Effect: Constructs a composite criterion using a logical operator.
Steps:
1.	Type newBinaryCri followed by the new criterion name, first criterion, logical operator, and second criterion (e.g., newBinaryCri cr3 cr1 && cr2).
2.	Press Enter.
Printing All Defined Criteria
Command: printAllCriteria
Effect: Prints out all the defined criteria.
Steps:
1.	Type printAllCriteria.
2.	Press Enter.
3.	View the list of all defined criteria.
